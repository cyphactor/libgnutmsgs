1.  What Is It?

    lib_gnut_msgs is a library which implemnets the Gnutella protocol
    according to the 0.6 rfc draft.

2.  Building

    This project's build sequence is managed by the autotools. Hence,
    the following command sequence can be used to build the project in
    any of the unix varients (include Mac OS-X).
    
    $ ./bootstrap.sh && ./configure && make

    However, to build a version for windows system from a Debian Linux
    Etch (testing) box, one needs to first install the mingw32 package
    via the following:

    # apt-get install mingw32

    Once, the mingw32 package is insalled one can trivially build
    Windows binaries of the project by using the following command
    sequence:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh && ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc && make

3.  Systems Tested On

    The following systems are all the systems which lib_gnut_msgs has
    been successfully run on.

    - Linux Debian Etch (Testing)
