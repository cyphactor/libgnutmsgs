- implement connection recycling such that servers which allow TCP
  connections but reject us with a 503 get popped off the top of the
  server list and appended to the bottom for later trial.

- fix the build query msg payload function and test it to make sure it
  is working, once that is complete then test the msg broadcast
  implementation.
